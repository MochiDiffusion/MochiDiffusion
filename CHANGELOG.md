# [Mochi Ice Cream (v2.4)](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion/releases/tag/v2.4) - 17 Feb 2023

Who remembers the release of Mac OS X **Snow** Leopard? üôã

At WWDC 2009, **Snow** Leopard was advertised with having under the hood improvements rather than adding more features. It was famously marketed as having "zero new features"

![snow-leopard-0-new-features](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1341760/219689922-736dfd18-0e74-4e91-b7da-f6ccd2676641.jpg)

Just like **Snow** Leopard, this new release of Mochi Diffusion includes many under the hood improvements that improves performance and stability. It should also help simplify adding new features down the line

The successor of Leopard was called **Snow** Leopard to denote it as a refinement. Therefore I found it appropriate to call this release...

ü•Åü•Åü•Å

**Mochi Ice Cream**

Also both snow and ice cream are somewhat similar, who knew? ‚ùÑÔ∏èüç¶

It also proudly has "zero new features." Well, there is _one_ new feature...

![Screen Recording](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1341760/219784941-9a4188fa-530a-42bc-99fc-13d152125cc2.gif)

A nice animation has been added when removing images from the Gallery üòé

Also "zero new features" doesn't mean much didn't change. Actually there were a lot of changes...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1341760/219790132-0e620023-4b30-431b-81d0-8d6823a212d4.png)

I've converted a few models for Mochi Diffusion [here](https://huggingface.co/godly-devotion).

Read the explanation for [Compute Unit](https://github.com/godly-devotion/mochi-diffusion#compute-unit) and [Models](https://github.com/godly-devotion/mochi-diffusion#models) to understand the difference between `split_einsum` and `original` (_tl;dr_ download the `split_einsum` version to use Neural Engine).


# [v1.3](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion/releases/tag/v1.3) - 30 Dec 2022

**When trying to open the app for the first time, Gatekeeper will prevent you from doing so because the app is not code signed. In order to bypass this warning, you need to right-click on the app and select "Open". You will have to do this twice in order to get the option to open the app.**

- Added ability to stop image generation
- Added border around the currently selected image in the Gallery
- Changed help text for Reduce Memory Usage option
- Fixed minor bugs

Tip: DPM-Solver++ Scheduler works very well with only 10-25 steps

- View the gallery while images are being generated
- Reorganized some options in the sidebar
- Added Number of Batches option
    - Each batch increments the seed by 1 making it easier to regenerate the same image
- Added Images per Batch option (previously called Number of Images)

Note: [Number of Batches] x [Images per Batch] = [Total Number of Images Generated]

There are many things lacking in this version as I just learned SwiftUI within the course of 2 days while battling COVID.
More features and UI adjustments will come later.
